                                                      Bill Burgers
                                                      
The purpose of the application is to help Bills Burgers to manage their process of selling hamburgers.

Our application will help Bill to select types of burgers, some of the additional items (additions) to be added to the burgers and pricing.

We want to create a base hamburger, but also two other types of hamburgers that are popular ones in Bills store.

The basic hamburger should have the following items.
1. Bread roll type, meat and up to 4 additional additions (things like lettuce, tomato, carrot and onion) that the customer can select to be added to the burger.

    	Each one of these items gets charged an additional price and to calculate the final price .

    	This burger has a base price and the additions are all seperately priced (up to 4 additions, see above).

Create a Hamburger class to deal with all the above.

The constructor should only include the roll type, meat and price, can also include name of burger or you can use setter.

Also create two extra varieties of Hamburgers (subclasses) to cater for :-

2. Healthy burger (on a brown rye bread roll), plus two addition items can be added.
The healthy burger can have 6 items (Additions) in total.

3. Deluxe hamburger - comes with chips and drinks as additions, but no extra additions are allowed.

All 3 classes should have a method that can be called anytime to show the base price of the hamburger plus  all additionals, each showing the addition name, and addition price, and a grand/final total for the burger (base price + all additions).

For the two additional classes this may require you to be looking at the base class for pricing and then adding totals to final price.
